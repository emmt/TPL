# TAO Processing Library

TPL (for *TAO Processing Library*) is a small library of functions for
processing images in TAO framework. After testing, it is intended that this
library becomes one of the parts of TAO.  For now it is available independently
because to relax constraints about compilation flags and dependencies like
[PVC](https://github.com/emmt/PVC) or the [Vector Class
Library](https://github.com/vectorclass/version2/releases).
